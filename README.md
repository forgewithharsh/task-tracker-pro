#  To-Do List App

A simple and elegant **To-Do List App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — a part of my *Back to Basics* web development practice project inspired by **CodeWithHarry Sir**.

---

##  Project Overview

This project helps manage daily tasks efficiently — you can **add**, **delete**, and **mark tasks as completed**.  
It’s a great hands-on way to strengthen **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **localStorage** concepts in JavaScript.

##  Features

-  Mark tasks as done  
-  Delete tasks
